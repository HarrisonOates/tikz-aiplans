# <aiplans>: A TikZ-Based Library for Drawing POCL Plans

<aiplans> is a specialized LaTeX package designed to assist scientists, students, and professionals in creating high-quality graphical representations, particularly Partial Order Causal Link (POCL) plans. Built on the robust TikZ framework, this library simplifies the process of generating complex, precise diagrams that are essential for academic and scientific communication. Our package is especially useful in fields such as artificial intelligence and planning, where visualizing causal relationships and dependencies is fundamental.
